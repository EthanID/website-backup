		    <h1>What is this blog?</h1>
		    <p>Behind every tree, rock, and mushroom we see, there are millions of stories. Some of these stories take place in our time and some of them have their first chapters in the beginning of the Earth and span times we can not fathom. This blog is an attempt to tell some of these stories. Stories of the intelligence in twining vines, the genetic genius of mushroom hyphae, and the marks of extreme conditions born on rocks. In hearing these stories I hope we can open our eyes to the beauty of the world.</p>
